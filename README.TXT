USER INSTRUCTIONS:

IMPORTANT: Never "x" out of a prompt, or press cancel!

At the beginning of the game, the applet will ask for 
the number of players that will be playing the game.
Input the number 2 or 3, then choose the names for each
player. Each name must be distinct.

Now each player will be dealt 3 normal destination cards
and 1 long route destination card (this card will be worth 
the most points out of all 4 cards). Each player must select
at least 2 cards to keep. Then each player is given 45 train tokens
and 4 train cards.

Then the real gameplay begins. During each turn, the players will
have a few options. A player may draw train cards during his/her turn.
This is done by clicking on either the train card deck or the top
5 revealed train cards on the right side of the screen. If a player
chooses to draw a locomotive card at first, that will be the only
card the player may draw that turn. If a player draws a colored
train card or draws a train card from the deck, he/she will not
be able to pick up a locomotive card from the top 5, but will still 
be allowed to draw a colored train card from the top 5, or from the 
main deck.

The player may draw more destination tickets. This is done
by clicking on the brown destination deck next to the train card 
deck. The player must select at least one destination ticket to 
keep. 

The player may check his/her destinations. This can be done anytime 
during your turn (unless there is a prompt, like when you're drawing
destination tickets). This is done by clicking on the destination ticket
with "Your Destinations" labeled under it.

And lastly, the player may capture a route. This is done by clicking 
on the two cities that form the route that the player wants to capture.
When clicked on, if it is a valid, unoccupied route, then, if the route
is gray, a prompt will be given to the user asking which colored cards
he/she would like to use to capture the route, and then give all options
on how to capture that route, based on the number of colored cards in the 
hand and locomotives in the hand. If the route is colored, it will give
all options for that color. However, if the player does not have the 
correct number of train cards or train tokens, then the player will
not be allowed to capture the route. Routes give points to the player 
based on how long they are. Routes of length 1 give the player 1 point,
2 gives 2 points, 3 gives 4 points, 4 gives 7 points, 5 gives 10 points,
and 6 gives 15 points.

Note: Routes that have a train token symbol or X's on them are special.
Routes with X's are mountain routes, which require an extra train
token per X on the route. Each mountain gives the player an additional
2 points for capturing the route. Routes with the train symbol are ferry 
routes and require the player to use at least one locomotive card to
capture the route.

Ending the game:
When a player has 2 or less train tokens at the end of the turn, the last set 
of turns start, starting with the next player. For example, if player 2 has 2 
or less train tokens at the end of his/her turn, and it's a game with 3
players, then the remaining turns go player 3 -> player 1 -> player 2 -> end.
At the end each player will be given points for completed routes, and will
lose points for incomplete routes, based on the route's value. The
player with the largest component in the graph of connected cities,
in other words, has the most cities connected, will be awarded 10
points. If there's a tie, each player in the tie will receive 10 points.

Then, the winner is determined. The player with the highest score wins.
If there's a tie, the player with the most completed destinations wins.
If there's still a tie, the player with the most mountains captured wins.
And if there's still a tie, no one wins!
